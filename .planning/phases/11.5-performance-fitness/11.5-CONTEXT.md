# Phase 11.5: Performance & Fitness - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Similar to the body metrics page — clean, simple data entry with visual progress tracking. Patients log their gym PRs (personal records) for major lifts like squat, bench press, and deadlift. Over time, they see line charts showing their strength progression.

This serves as evidence that hormone therapy is working. When patients see their lifts going up over months of treatment, it reinforces the value of the program.

The training log is secondary — freeform notes for workout journaling if they want to capture more detail. Nutrition logging is basic/optional for now, with a placeholder for future STNDRD app integration.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **PR tracking with charts** — Enter lift data (exercise, weight, reps, date), see progress over time in line charts
- **Consistent patterns** — Same UX as body metrics page (form at top, charts below, clean layout)
- **Quick entry** — Adding a PR should be fast, not require filling out a complex workout form

## Specific Ideas

- Major lifts to track: Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Overhead Press, Barbell Row (the "big 5")
- Allow custom exercises too (patients may want to track leg press, curls, etc.)
- Charts similar to body metrics — select which lift to view, see trend over time
- Optional: training notes section for freeform workout journaling
- Future: STNDRD app integration placeholder (noted in roadmap)

## Additional Context

This phase follows the same patterns as Phase 11 (body metrics). The database schema will be similar — a table for exercise_prs with patient_id, exercise name, weight, reps, date.

Nutrition logging is mentioned in roadmap but is low priority. Can be a simple notes field or deferred to future STNDRD integration.
